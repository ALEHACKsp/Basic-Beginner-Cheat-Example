# Read-Write-organization-Cheat-Example
A basic repository for redirecting people who dont know much about game hacking/organization

#NOTE: This example does not bypass any anti-cheat nor will it ever

#Includes:
* Read & Write Template
* GetModuleBase function
* Comments/Explinations for the code

#Information:
- To Learn c++ there are some great websites like this -https://www.learncpp.com/
- For some great resources on where to start -https://guidedhacking.com/threads/ghb0-game-hacking-bible-introduction.14450/
- This is meant to people new to game hacking or people trying to get better at organization.
- Within the contents of the .zip file there is the source code for an 'Assualt Cube' game hack, with this it should be up to the user to update and make changes to make it work.
